## 🔑 Spotify Developer Setup (Client ID & Secret)

To use this MCP server, you need to register a free developer application with Spotify to obtain your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Open the Spotify Developer Dashboard
1. Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).
2. Log in with your standard Spotify account.

### Step 2: Create a New Application
1. Click the **"Create app"** button in the top right.
2. Fill out the application details:
   - **App name**: e.g., `Spotify MCP Server` (or any name you prefer).
   - **App description**: e.g., `MCP Server bridging Spotify API with AI assistants`.
   - **Redirect URIs**: Enter `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback` and click **Add**.
     > ⚠️ **Important**: The redirect URI must match `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback` exactly (including the port and path).
   - **Which API/SDKs are you planning to use?**: Select/check **Web API**.
3. Check the checkbox agreeing to the Spotify Developer Terms of Service and click **Save**.

### Step 3: Copy Your Client ID & Client Secret
1. On your newly created app page, click **Settings** (top right) or go to the **Basic Information** tab.
2. You will see your **Client ID**. Copy it.
3. Click **"View client secret"** to reveal your **Client Secret**. Copy it.

### Step 4: (Optional) Add User Accounts in Development Mode
By default, Spotify developer apps start in **Development Mode**:
- Your own Spotify account (the app creator) is automatically authorized.
- If you want other Spotify accounts to use your app, go to **Settings** > **User Management** and add their Spotify email addresses.

## ⚙️ Environment Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project (copy from `.env.example`):
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Add your credentials into `.env`:
   ```env
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID="your_spotify_client_id_here"
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET="your_spotify_client_secret_here"
   SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI="http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback"

   # Optional Settings
   SPOTIFY_TOKEN_CACHE_PATH=".spotify_token.json"
   MCP_SERVER_NAME="Spotify MCP Server"
   ```

---

## 🚀 Installation & Running

```bash
# 1. Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# 2. Install dependencies (including development dependencies)
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# 3. Run the MCP server entrypoint
python3 main.py
```

On your first run or when authorization is needed:
- A browser window will automatically open asking you to log into Spotify and authorize the requested permissions.
- The local server on port `8888` will capture the OAuth callback and save the cached tokens to `.spotify_token.json`.
- Subsequent runs will automatically reuse and refresh the token in the background.

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite using `pytest`:

```bash
pytest
```
